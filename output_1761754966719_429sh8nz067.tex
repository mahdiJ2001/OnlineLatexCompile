%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) role at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative smart home solutions. With a strong foundation in C/C++ and embedded programming, I am confident in my ability to design and develop low-level software for IoT devices and sensors, aligning with the company's mission to create the next generation of connected systems.

    Throughout my experiences, I have demonstrated my capability to work on diverse projects, from developing IoT-based systems using C++ and Raspberry Pi to building machine learning models for predictive maintenance. My experience with communication protocols such as MQTT and my familiarity with IoT platforms like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi make me a strong fit for this role. I am also excited about the opportunity to collaborate with hardware engineers to integrate sensors and actuators, and to write unit tests and perform debugging using tools like JTAG and GDB.

    I am particularly drawn to Bosch Connected Devices' commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. My own principles of collaboration, dedication, and continuous improvement resonate strongly with the company's values. I am eager to be part of a team that values adaptability, problem-solving, and agile development, and I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this position.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills, experience, and passion for IoT and C++ align with your needs, and how I can contribute meaningfully to your team. I look forward to the possibility of joining Bosch Connected Devices and helping drive its mission forward with commitment, passion, and integrity.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Karim Haddad
