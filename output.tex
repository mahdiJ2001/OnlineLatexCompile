%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am excited to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) position at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative smart home solutions. With a strong foundation in C/C++ and embedded programming, I am confident in my ability to design and develop low-level software for IoT devices and sensors, aligning with the company's mission to create connected systems that improve people's lives.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience with IoT platforms, including Raspberry Pi, and have developed a solid understanding of hardware communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and UART. My experience with MQTT, BLE, and HTTP protocols has also prepared me to implement communication protocols effectively. Notably, my internships at Telnet Innovation Labs and InstaDeep have equipped me with the skills to work on IoT-based projects, including the development of C++ modules for embedded data acquisition and the creation of real-time monitoring dashboards.

    I am particularly drawn to Bosch Connected Devices' commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. As a team player with a strong sense of responsibility and adaptability, I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with hardware engineers, integrate sensors and actuators, and contribute to the development of next-generation connected systems. My portfolio, which includes projects such as the Smart Parking System and the Home Energy Monitor, demonstrates my ability to design and develop IoT-based solutions that are both functional and efficient.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss how my skills and experience align with the requirements of the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) position and how I can contribute to the success of Bosch Connected Devices. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and be a part of the company's mission to shape the future of connected living.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Karim Haddad
