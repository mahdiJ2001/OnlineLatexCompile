%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer position at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative connected systems. With a strong foundation in software engineering and a keen interest in embedded systems, I am confident that I would be an excellent fit for your team.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that have deepened my understanding of embedded systems and IoT. Notably, I developed C++ modules for embedded data acquisition and created a real-time monitoring dashboard for an IoT-based telemetry system in my internship at Telnet Innovation Labs. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to work on low-level software development for IoT devices and sensors at Bosch Connected Devices.

    In addition to my technical skills, I possess a strong set of soft skills that would enable me to collaborate effectively with hardware engineers, integrate sensors and actuators, and write unit tests and perform debugging using tools like JTAG and GDB. My experience with IoT platforms, such as ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, and my understanding of hardware communication protocols, including I2C, SPI, and UART, would also be valuable assets to your team.

    I am particularly drawn to Bosch Connected Devices' commitment to innovation and excellence in the field of IoT. I am impressed by the company's mission to create smart home solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives, and I am excited about the opportunity to be a part of a team that shares my values and passion for technology.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss my qualifications further and explain in greater detail why I am the ideal candidate for this role. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Bosch Connected Devices' success and growth.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]
