%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) position at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative connected systems. With a strong foundation in C/C++ and embedded programming, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal fit for this role.

    Throughout my experiences, I have developed a keen interest in IoT-based projects, particularly in low-level software development for microcontrollers. My previous internship at Telnet Innovation Labs, where I worked on an IoT-based telemetry system for automotive applications, has given me a deep understanding of C++ modules for embedded data acquisition and real-time monitoring dashboards. I am excited about the prospect of working on similar projects at Bosch Connected Devices and contributing to the next generation of connected systems.

    As a detail-oriented and collaborative individual, I thrive in environments where teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability are valued. My experience with tools like MQTT, Raspberry Pi, and InfluxDB has equipped me with the skills to implement communication protocols and integrate sensors and actuators. I am also eager to learn and grow with the company, and I am confident that my strong work ethic and commitment to excellence would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to your team.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills and experience align with your needs and how I can contribute to the success of Bosch Connected Devices. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and being part of the company's mission to drive innovation in the field of IoT and connected systems.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Karim Haddad
