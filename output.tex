%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the AI Software Engineer position at NeuroGrid Technologies, where I can leverage my passion for artificial intelligence and software development to drive innovative solutions. With a strong foundation in deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, I am confident in my ability to design and implement production-grade AI models for NLP, computer vision, and forecasting tasks. My experience with deploying ML models to cloud environments, such as AWS SageMaker, has prepared me to work with large datasets and perform preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong commitment to collaboration, continuous learning, and delivering high-quality results. My experience as a Backend Developer Intern at Wevioo and Software Engineering Intern at TechLabs Tunisia has taught me the importance of working closely with cross-functional teams to achieve meaningful outcomes. I am excited about the opportunity to join NeuroGrid Technologies and contribute my skills and experience to the development of intelligent systems that power predictive analytics, recommendation engines, and autonomous decision-making tools.

    I am particularly drawn to NeuroGrid Technologies' mission to create innovative AI solutions that drive business value. My projects, such as the AI Resume Analyzer and Medical Image Classifier, demonstrate my ability to apply AI and machine learning concepts to real-world problems. I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my passion for AI and software development, make me an ideal candidate for this role.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills and experience align with your needs and how I can contribute to the success of NeuroGrid Technologies. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Mahdi Jellali
