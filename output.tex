%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am excited to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) position at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative smart home solutions. With a strong foundation in embedded programming and a keen interest in the next generation of connected systems, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal fit for this role.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience with C++ and embedded systems, particularly in the context of IoT applications. My experience in developing and optimizing embedded C++ code for microcontrollers, implementing communication protocols such as MQTT and BLE, and collaborating with hardware engineers to integrate sensors and actuators, aligns closely with the responsibilities of this position. For instance, in my internship at Telnet Innovation Labs, I worked on an IoT-based telemetry system for automotive applications, where I developed C++ modules for embedded data acquisition and created a real-time monitoring dashboard using MQTT and Raspberry Pi.

    I am particularly drawn to Bosch Connected Devices' commitment to innovation and excellence in the field of IoT. The company's mission to create smart and connected solutions resonates with my own values and goals. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team that shares my passion for IoT and C++ and is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills, experience, and passion for IoT and C++ can contribute to the success of Bosch Connected Devices. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and be a part of the company's mission to shape the future of smart home solutions.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Karim Haddad
