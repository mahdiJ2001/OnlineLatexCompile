Notably, my experience with developing and optimizing embedded C++ code for microcontrollers, as well as implementing unit tests and debugging using tools like JTAG and GDB, positions me well for this role.

    I am particularly drawn to Bosch Connected Devices' mission to create innovative solutions for the smart home division. My enthusiasm for collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability, as well as my experience working on projects that require teamwork and effective communication, makes me a strong candidate for this position. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to the development of next-generation connected systems and growing alongside a talented team of professionals.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills, experience, and passion for IoT and C++ development align with the needs of Bosch Connected Devices.
