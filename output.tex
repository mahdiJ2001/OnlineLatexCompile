%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the Machine Learning Engineer position at NeuroGrid Technologies, where I can leverage my passion for AI and data science to drive innovation and excellence. With a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in machine learning, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal fit for this role. I am particularly drawn to NeuroGrid's commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI and its applications, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team that shares my enthusiasm for collaborative problem-solving and continuous learning.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals, including proficiency in Python and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow. My experience in building and deploying scalable models for image recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics has prepared me well for the challenges of this role. I am also familiar with MLOps tools, including MLflow, and have a strong understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Notably, my project experience with the Medical Image Classifier, which achieved 92% accuracy in detecting lung diseases from X-rays, demonstrates my ability to design, train, and deploy models that enhance automation and intelligence.

    I am a strong believer in the power of collaboration and teamwork, and I have a proven track record of working effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve common goals. My experience as a Backend Developer Intern at Wevioo, where I contributed to a microservices-based patient management system using Spring Boot and Kafka, has taught me the importance of asynchronous event handling and optimization. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to NeuroGrid Technologies and contribute to the development of innovative AI solutions.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills, experience, and passion for machine learning align with the needs of NeuroGrid Technologies. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to the company's mission to advance the field of AI.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Mahdi Jellali
