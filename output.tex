%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am excited to apply for the Junior Embedded Software Engineer (IoT & C++) role at Bosch Connected Devices, where I can leverage my passion for IoT and C++ to contribute to the development of innovative connected systems. With a strong foundation in embedded programming and a keen interest in the latest technologies, I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to your team.

    Throughout my experiences, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that demonstrate my skills in developing and optimizing embedded C++ code for microcontrollers, implementing communication protocols such as MQTT and BLE, and collaborating with hardware engineers to integrate sensors and actuators. My experience with Raspberry Pi and IoT platforms has also given me a solid understanding of the intricacies of IoT device development. Notably, my work on the Smart Parking System and Home Energy Monitor projects has shown me the importance of efficient data transmission and visualization, which I believe would be highly relevant to this role.

    As a detail-oriented and enthusiastic engineer, I thrive in environments where collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability are encouraged. I am excited about the prospect of joining Bosch Connected Devices and contributing my skills and experience to the development of next-generation connected systems. I am confident that my strong work ethic, commitment to excellence, and passion for IoT and C++ would make me a valuable asset to your team.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills and experience align with the requirements of this role and how I can contribute to the success of Bosch Connected Devices.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Karim Haddad
