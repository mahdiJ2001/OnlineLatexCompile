%-----------BODY-----------
    Dear Hiring Manager,

    I am thrilled to apply for the Backend Software Engineer role at OrbitX Labs, where I can leverage my passion for building scalable, high-performance systems to contribute to your cloud-based analytics platform. With a strong foundation in distributed systems, backend engineering, and applied mathematics, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal fit for this position.

    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience with a range of technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, Python, and Go. Notably, in my role as a Backend Developer Intern at Wevioo, I contributed to a microservices-based patient management system using Spring Boot, Kafka, and gRPC, improving backend performance by implementing asynchronous event handling and optimizing serialization. Additionally, my experience with cloud platforms, such as AWS, and CI/CD pipelines will enable me to hit the ground running at OrbitX Labs.

    I am particularly drawn to OrbitX Labs' mission to revolutionize intelligent data infrastructure. My projects, such as the Smart Home Energy Monitor and the Autonomous Irrigation Controller, demonstrate my ability to design and implement efficient systems that make a tangible impact. I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with your team to build innovative solutions that drive business value and growth.

    Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to discuss in greater detail how my skills, experience, and passion for backend engineering align with your needs and how I can contribute to the success of OrbitX Labs. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and being part of a fast-paced environment that values collaboration, dedication, and continuous growth.

    Sincerely,\\[12pt]

    Mahdi Jellali
